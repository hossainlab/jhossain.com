<h1>Update with <code>markovifyR</code></h1>
<p>Thanks to Maëlle Salmon, who referred me to <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/15/thanks-million-jon-skeet/">this post</a> by Julia Silge and Nick Larsen, I explored doing this using the <code>markovifyR</code> package, and the results are unbelievable. <a href="#update">See the bottom of the post for an updated batch of sonnets!</a></p>
</div>
<div id="original-post" class="section level1">
<h1>Original post</h1>
<p>I recently saw <a href="http://katiejolly.io/blog/2018-01-05/random-rupi-markov-chain-poems">Katie Jolly’s post</a>, in which she produced Rupi Kuar-style poems using Markov Chains in R. I absolutely loved it, so I decided to try it with Shakespeare’s 154 sonnets using her post as a skeleton.</p>
</div>
<div id="downloading-and-cleaning-the-sonnets" class="section level1">
<h1>Downloading and cleaning the sonnets</h1>
<p>In addition to <code>markovchain</code> and <code>tidyverse</code>, I’m going to use the <code>gutenberger</code> package to download the sonnets.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(gutenbergr)
library(tidyverse) 
library(markovchain) </code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>shakespeare &lt;- gutenberg_works(title == &quot;Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnets&quot;) %&gt;% 
  pull(gutenberg_id) %&gt;% 
  gutenberg_download(verbose = FALSE)

<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2,625 x 2

##           &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;

##  2         1041 &quot;&quot;                                            
##  3         1041 by William Shakespeare                        
##  4         1041 &quot;&quot;                                            
##  5         1041 &quot;&quot;

## # … with 2,615 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Because the sonnets are in <code>gutenberger</code>, they’re already in a nice format to work with. I just need to do a little cleaning up: like Katie, I removed the punctuation, but I also have to clear out the sonnet titles, which were Roman numerals, and some title info.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#  a little function to make life easier
`%not_in%` &lt;- function(lhs, rhs) {
  !(lhs %in% rhs)
}

#  remove new lines symbol, sonnet Roman numerals, and punctation
#  and split into vector
bills_words &lt;- shakespeare %&gt;% 
  mutate(text = text %&gt;% 
    str_trim() %&gt;% 
    str_replace_all(&quot;--&quot;, &quot; &quot;) %&gt;% 
    str_replace_all(&quot;[^[:alnum:][:space:]&#39;]&quot;, &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% 
    str_replace_all(&quot;^M{0,4}(CM|CD|D?C{0,3})(XC|XL|L?X{0,3})(IX|IV|V?I{0,3})$&quot;, 
                    &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% 
    str_to_lower()) %&gt;% 
  filter(text %not_in% c(&quot;the sonnets&quot;, &quot;by william shakespeare&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot; &quot;)) %&gt;% 
  pull(text) %&gt;% 
  str_split(&quot; &quot;) %&gt;% 
  unlist() </code></pre>
<p>I’m also going to extract the punctuation and assess how many of each there are for when I actually assemble the sonnets later.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>punctuation &lt;- shakespeare %&gt;% 
  pull(text) %&gt;% 
  str_extract_all(&quot;[^[:alnum:][:space:]&#39;]&quot;) %&gt;%

  prop.table()</code></pre>

<div id="fit-the-markov-chain" class="section level1">

<p>And finally, here are a few functions to piece together lines to make them look like a sonnet using the <code>walk()</code> function from <code>purrr</code> to print out the lines (since it’s a side effect). No, they’re not actually iambic pentameter :(</p>

<h1>Update</h1>
<p>Alright, this time I’m going to try it with the <code>markovifyR</code> package. I’m basically going to do the same cleaning as above, but this time I’ll be putting entire sentences, punctuation and all, into the Markov model. The <code>markovify_text()</code> function also accepts start words, so I thought it might look good to start with a sample of 100 starting words from the sonnets and construct the lines from there.</p>
