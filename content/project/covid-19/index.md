title: "COVID-19"
summary: "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a newly discovered coronavirus-borne infection.

Seniors and those with underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are at an increased risk of developing serious illness."
