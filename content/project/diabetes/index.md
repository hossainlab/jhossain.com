title: "Diabetes"
summary: "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that is characterized by elevated blood glucose (or blood sugar) levels. Over time, diabetes can cause serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. The most common type of diabetes, which typically affects adults, occurs when the body develops resistance to insulin or produces insufficient insulin."
