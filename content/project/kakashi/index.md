kakashi is a theme for the [xaringan R package](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) for making slides. kakashi has a clean look with color-blind friendly palettes. Marking text as italics (&ast;) will turn it blue, bold (&ast;&ast;) will turn it orange, and striking out (~~) will turn it grey. kakashi copies ideas from many other themes, including metropolis and lucy, but is ultimately unique. That is why this CSS (copy shinobi style) is called kakashi, [after the copy ninja](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kakashi_Hatake).
