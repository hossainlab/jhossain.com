This notebook contains R code for part 2 of [Causal Inference](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) by Miguel Hern√°n and Jamie Robins. While R, SAS, Stata, and Python code are available on the website for Causal Inference, we focus on doing causal inference using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem of R packages, particularly ggplot2, dplyr, and broom.
