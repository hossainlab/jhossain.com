I love to take notes. When I am learning something new, I always try to write down those topics for future purposes. Here are some of my notes related to data science, specifically in health data science and genomic data science. These notes are hosted on Github as an online book using JupyterBook. You can read the notes on the website and download them from the Github repository.

I teach the following courses at [CHIRAL Bangladesh](). Some of my courses have course websites which you can navigate to below. For many of my classes I make lecture videos, which can be found on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbkJ5pm65Fkcs7MK4YshLsQ).
