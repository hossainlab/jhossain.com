I love to take notes. When I am learning something new, I always try to write down those topics for future purposes.  Here are some of my notes related to data science, specifically in health data science and genomic data science. These notes are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/hossainlab) as an online book using [JupyterBook](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html). You can read the notes on the website and download them from the Github repository.

[Introduction to Numpy](https://hossainlab.github.io/numpy/) -- NumPy is a Python package that stands for ‘Numerical Python.’ It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object. In addition, provide tools for integrating C, C++, etc. It is also helpful in linear algebra, random number capability.

<hr>

[Pandas for Data Analysis](https://hossainlab.github.io/pandas/) -- The Pandas library is built on NumPy and provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. A one-dimensional labeled array a capable of holding any data type. A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.

[Data Visualization with Python](https://hossainlab.github.io/dataviz/) -- A picture is worth a thousand words” Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is easier than poring over spreadsheets or reports. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner – and you can experiment with different scenarios by making slight adjustments.

[Applied Machine Learning for Healthcare](https://hossainlab.github.io/dataviz/) -- Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It focuses of systems, thereby allowing them to learn and make predictions based on some experience which is data in case of machines.

[Introduction to R](https://www.rpubs.com/jhossain/728718) -- R is a dialect of S(R is an implementation of the S programming language).R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is developed by the R Development Core Team. R is a programming language and environment commonly used in statistical computing, data analytics and scientific research.

[Data Management with R: An Inroduction to dplyr](https://www.rpubs.com/jhossain/728732) -- The dplyr package was developed by Hadley Wickham of RStudio. `dplyr` is a new package which provides a set of tools for efficiently manipulating datasets in R. dplyr is the next iteration of plyr , focussing on only data frames. With dplyr , anything you can do to a local data frame you can also do to a remote database table. analytics and scientific research.

[Interpreting Data Using Inferential Statistics with R](https://www.rpubs.com/jhossain/730613) -- Inferential statistical methods provide a confirmatory data analysis. This tutorial covers the basics of hypothesis testing using R programming.

<hr>

[Genomic Data Visualization using R](https://www.rpubs.com/jhossain/750077) -- ggplot2 is a data visualization package for the statistical programming language R. Created by Hadley Wickham in 2005, ggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics—a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers.
