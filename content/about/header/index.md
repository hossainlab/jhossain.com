<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Graduate student at the Department of Microbiology at Jagannath University, Dhaka. I aspire to maximize the quality of life of the human around me by working at the intersection of education, technology, and health research.

I am the founder of Center for Health Innovation, Research, Action and Learning - Bangladesh (CHIRAL Bangladesh), a non-profit organization dedicated to health research to improve lives in Bangladesh.

At CHIRAL Bangladesh, I lead two programs: Scientific Computing for Biologists and the other one is Health Data Analytics. In addition, I make content on Data Analysis with Python and R.

Python is my primary language for data analysis and machine learning. I also have a basic understanding of R, Julia, SPSS, QGIS, and SQL.
