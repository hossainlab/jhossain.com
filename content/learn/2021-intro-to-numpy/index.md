Welcome to Introduction to NumPy. This is a short sequence of notes on NumPy for scientific work, specially in the field of data science written by Jubayer Hossian.

## What is NumPy?
NumPy is a Python package which stands for ‘Numerical Python’.

- It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object.
- Provide tools for integrating C, C++ etc.
- It is also useful in linear algebra, random number capability etc.
- Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
- NumPy array can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container for generic data.
