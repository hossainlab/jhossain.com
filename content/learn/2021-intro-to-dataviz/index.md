Welcome to Data Visualization using Python. This is a short sequence of notes on Data Visualization for scientific work, specially in the field of data science written by Jubayer Hossian. 

## Why is data visualization important?

> “A picture is worth a thousand words” Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is easier than poring over spreadsheets or reports. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner – and you can experiment with different scenarios by making slight adjustments.
